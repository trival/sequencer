Bugs:

- [ ] Synth Player hangs after saving

Quick UI improvements:

- [ ] auto open duration dialog when adding a note via song controls and track
      controls

Basic App Navigation:

- [ ] toast to indicate remote action status
- [ ] add track collections, improve track organization
- [ ] Better song list
- [ ] delete a song

Player interaction:

- [ ] split a note after a given duration
- [ ] duplicate a track
- [ ] mute/unmute tracks, solo tracks
- [ ] indicate notes present on other tracks on at the same time on the keyboard
      when editing a note
- [ ] individual track volume (or instrument volume)

- [ ] general track settings with
  - [ ] default note duration
  - [ ] size per second
  - [ ] swing tempo
  - [ ] add/delete additional instrument
  - [ ] instrument settings (color, volume, sound settings)

Multi selection interactions

- [ ] select and copy/delete multiple notes
- [ ] merge notes

Future whishlist:

- [ ] transpose selected notes/track or whole song
- [ ] record rhythm from tapping a button
- [ ] record notes from playing the keyboard (probably with a metronome)
- [ ] send midi signals via webmidi
- [ ] name notes according to the selected scale base note (e.g. C#, F# and G#,
      when in key of A)

Done:

- [x] import/edit track json data
- [x] basic app navigation
- [x] fast add note button
- [x] no keyboard edit mode when playing, just playalong
- [x] add/delete additional tracks
- [x] change max keyboard size
- [x] no confirmation on delete note
- [x] no confirmation on note duration change
